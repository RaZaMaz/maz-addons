A simple mod that im currently working on that will have features that can help a lot of ppl. The current feature are:

* CPS counter 

*/pin to pin something to the top left of your screen ( i will add a feature later where you can move it around )

* Auto gg ( will make it toggleable )

* Auto wb! in guild chat ( will make it toggleable )

* Cords appearing in top left. Which is toggleable with /cords
